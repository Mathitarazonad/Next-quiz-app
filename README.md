## Overview

## About the App
This is an game application based on [Wordle](https://wordlegame.org/) and [Codycross](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fanatee.cody&hl=es&gl=US&pli=1) games made with the experimental **app** directory of Next 13. The game consists that the user needs to **guess** all the words in **3 different difficulties** in each level. There are 10 levels in the game, and each level have a **'topic'** to give the user a context of which type of words they are guessing and some abilities to use, the users need to complete the 3 difficulties in each level to unlock the next one. 

### The challenge

The challenges that I proposed to my self are:

- Make the game to be played on any device.
- Use **tailwindCss**.
- Implement a system of **authentication**.
- Implement a **levels system** of progression.
- Implement a service of **database** to store users game data.
- Implement **abilities** to help the user during the different levels.

### What I learned

*"Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project."*

This is my first project using Next, and I also decided to implement the experimental features of Next 13 in this case, like the **app directory**. I used this project lo learn about the Next framework and how it works, but I realized that Next 13 is not a stable version to use yet, but it has incredible features that I liked.

### Continued development

*"Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect."*

Now that I entered the world of frameworks like Next, I need to study more about the types of rendering and study which one is the appropriate according with the type of the page that I want to develop. And of course I need to continue studying frameworks like Next and other technologies.
